# Winning Solution of Hackerearth Machine Learning Hackathon

### Problem satement: Calculate the severity of an airplane accident

* The predictive problem is based on multicalss Classification with 4 features.

* In the preprocessing phase i have found there is no mising values as well as categorical variables in the data and there is some skewed parameter parameter. I have deleted the parameter.
I found the top 4 top features based on the Extra Trees Classifier to work with. Safety Score,Days_Since_Inspection,Control_Metric,Accident_Type_Code) are th most 4 relevant features for the algorithm.
All the depencies are removed.

* I have studied the distributions of the train and test test and found the pearson's Correlation to found the dependencies of the features.

* As for this multicalss classifiaction, I have tried several algorithms, ensemble Learning but Gradient Boosting Algorithm is found to be the most suitable and best algorithm.I have tuned the parameters of Gradient Boosting by tuning its parameter.
